## 2. Project Overview :bookmark_tabs:

> In this section, you reveal the main idea of the project, how you intend to use the Robonomics Network to bring your idea to life, and your motivation. The section should include the following information (max. one A4 page long):

1. What are the problems that the project is trying to solve?
Globally, more than a 6000 people die in industrial accidents per day and amount to a loss of $1250 billion annually according to International Labour Organization. A huge percentage of these fatal incidents occur in the chemical industry alone. Major causes usually come out to be human error, poor maintenance, non-availability of safety triggers, low quality control and substandard oversight. Unfortunately, the perpetrators of these accidents are usually ignored and not held responsible due to below par audit and data management. Most of the industries don’t use effective monitoring and feedback mechanism to avoid these accidents. Those who do use smart solutions like SCADA are prone to forgery in case of audit through changes in database. Robochemist addresses all these problems and provides a viable solution to each one of them. 
2. Why do you want Robonomics Network to be used for solving those problems? 
Because Rebonomics is a ready-to-work and an open source platform for IoT applications and is open source; moreover, under the hood it has both ETH and PolkaDot. Additionally, it has predefined the set of software i.e. MQTT support.
3. What are expected main result of the project?
A smart chemical dosage monitoring system will ensure quality assurance by monitoring key parameters and composition of the chemical. The feedback system will work as a means of preventive maintenance thereby reducing risk of any accident e.g. rupture of boiler etc. whereas the data itself will be secured through cryptographic encryption for audit purposes and preventing any forgery.
4. Do you plan to exploit the result in the future (academic, commercial)?
Yes. We are planning to deploy our solution commercially in the industry. Recently, we have secured a collaboration with a chemical provider SurfaceChemicals. They have provided us support and agreed to give us access to have the POC with their one of the most renowned multinational industry clients (i.e Pepsi, CocaCola, Nestle, K&N's… etc)   
5. What is your personal motivation to implement this project?
To save human lives, eliminate the cost of chemical industry accidents and ensure better products for everyone’s use.
6. Are there any other projects similar to yours? 
There is no other similar project which integrates everything in one package.
7. In what way is your project different from the existing ones?
Robochemist provides solution to problem at each step from quality control to feedback to audit. Hence, it is more integrated and inclusive than any existing project.

## 3. Technical Details :pager:

> Please, responsibly indicate if your project is based on third-party development and specify the authorship. The section should include the following information: 

1. An overview of the technology stack to be used. This may include items such as: 
    1. We will be using raspberry pi, Arduino, various sensors (for pH, temperature, acidity, density, volume flow rate etc.), Reactjs for frontend development.
    2.ii.	We will use robonomics-js  for connection: 
    https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/robonomics-js/
    Will use AIRA
    https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/aira-overview/

2. In the case of the prior development, any details about it: publications, repositories, articles, etc.
Do not have prior development, will start the development on Robonomics Network.
3. Details of how your project uses Robonomics Network.
Our project will use the AIRA of Robonomics to store data on Blockchain so that no one can change the details and real values can be used in audit.

## 5. Expected results :package:

> At the end of the project, Robochemist team plans to produce a working prototype of the system which will include monitoring the key parameters (pH, temperature, acidity, density, volume flow rate etc.) of the chemical being used in boiler etc. through multiple sensors, providing feedback on health of the boiler through measuring scale deposition for smart preventive maintenance, and saving data through cryptographic encryption to avoid any forgery. The report will include the theoretical and background research along with literature review. Articles, videos or blog posts for social media will be prepared in accordance with our implementation of the product at any multinational company (mentioned in additional information)
