## 2. Project Overview :bookmark_tabs:

Note: The Grant is requested in order to execute the initial stages of the Project, the Proof of Concept of data collection by  IoT sensors, connected to the Robonomics Networks. The full scope of the Project, described below, will be funded by other means. 

1.	We address the problem of obtaining accurate and automated measurements of volumes of pollutants (nitrates, phosphates, and greenhouse gases), and secure data storage of these numbers to analyse the environmental impact of farming activities against required environmental mitigation as imposed by regulators (Regional Councils). Automated data collection improves the veracity of information, reduces the cost of regulatory compliance for farmers (there are many requestors requiring reports submissions in the current settings: Regional Councils, District Councils, and MPI. Ministry of Environment, Power Boards, Fonterra, even SPCA). Current manual processes are unreliable, do not provide a unified interface for analytic processing due to the lack of consolidation and privacy concerns. In our approach the collected information is stored in distributed file storage with hashes recorded in a public blockchain, This approach creates immutable information storage with discretional data access, making possible the further project stages in logistics of agriculture exports, for example to produce export passport of food products, whereby supplying recorded proof of sustainable farming may be required in markets in jurisdictions with differing environmental standards, as all transactions are recorded and the digital passport grows with additional records reflecting all types of environmental mitigations expressed in different token transactions

2. Robonomics Network provides an interface for data collection, excluding manual input, thus offering trusted datasets used in computing farmers' environmental reputation    
3. The expected main result of the project is the generation of export certificate of farming production, containing a transparent record of environmental reputation  
4. Plans include both academic researches: a quantifiable justification of environmental programs in the public sector, converging interests of regulators and farmers; as well as commercialisation of marketplace to create a service framework for the participants of the farming ecosystem
5. Interest in environmental economic modelling and blockchainisation of economics as well as a perspective to commercialise the project for the benefits of primary industries in New Zealand, with further global scaling
6. DAO IPCI was a project utilising a similar approach in Carbon Trading. There is plenty of research in the area of the use of purpose-driven tokens, for example, from the P2P foundation or the Commons Stack, however, we are not aware of practical projects in the same space. Existing de-facto standards of nitrate pollution assessment in New Zealand is based on the models of nitrate diffusion (Overseer Models). Our approach offers direct measurements of the polluting factors. Existing sensors are either prohibitively expensive, or inaccurate (CropX) and do not provide an immutable record storage facility possible with Robonomics.     
7. The difference: we are addressing the needs of a specific set of stakeholders in farming, providing them with reliable data collected from remote sensing networks, providing information veracity and making the information available to analysis compliant with data privacy requirements. Sustainable agriculture is being considered from the triple-bottom-line accounting perspective, to optimise the profit profits of agriculture production while taking into account the environmental factors. The project could also provide an interface to Overseer models 

## 3. Technical Details :pager:

1. Our prototype is a tokenised peer-to-peer platform that can infer the precise nature of land use and the resulting water and soil pollution. The use of remote sensing methods provides independent verification of pollution and mitigation efforts. Our task is to measure the environmental effects of farming practices (such as greenhouse gas emission, nutrient pollution, water pollution etc.) and calculate fair mitigation efforts for sustainable farming.  
We intend to create a framework under which the communities can sustainably self-govern themselves. The decentralized and self-enforcing nature of blockchain-based smart contracts guarantees that decisions, made within this framework, are executed without censorship or control from higher-level authorities. 
Another key benefit of our offering is that by combining meteorological and climate change modelling data with historical land use information for a particular farm, we can provide farmers with more precise water and soil pollution modelling as long as they provide current and up to date land use data. Such precise (and especially historical) land use data can in turn be used to re-train and improve our inference based on the land data for the other farms where we either cannot or are not allowed to obtain the detailed land use and water and soil contamination data.
2.	In designing a parametric model of sustainable farming economics we plan to use an empirical approach that will allow translation of existing climate programs from regulators (regional councils) coined by environmental scientists into agent interactions and volumes of pollution. The use of existing climate programs is important as they provide external valuation in the auction.   STELLA online modelling tools are used  for simple experiments in the tragedy of commons  https://www.iseesystems.com/store/products/stella-online.aspx 
To build a multiplayer strategy for public goods games and auctions,  we are planning to use the framework based on Python https://www.otree.org/.  Building parametric models of social enterprise are done with the use of cadCAD tool to simulate the impact that a set of actions might have on it (using Monte Carlo simulations): CadCAD is a python based modeling framework for research, validation, and design of complex systems https://cadcad.org/. And finally, the marketplace code might be to be constructed on open-source decentralised exchange code – such as https://uniswap.org/ or https://www.openware.com/product/opendax
3.	We plan to purchase sensors from Hach, most likely HL4: [https://www.ott.com/products/water-quality-2/hydrolab-hl4-multiparameter-sonde-54/](https://www.ott.com/products/water-quality-2/hydrolab-hl4-multiparameter-sonde-54/) and deploy each in a stream going through each of the participant farms to produce a monitored node providing the estimate of NO3 leeching for each farm. We will either purchase off the shelf or develop custom components for the battery and connectivity (via CAT-M1 connection using Spark - a local mobile connectivity provider supporting IoT deployments).
Once each node is connected via the Robonomics Network, we plan to develop the  AgriDataTrade marketplace platform that incorporates the relevant sensors to produce a trustworthy decentralised record of relevant pollution readings for each participant time. Once the platform is validated to produce trustworthy information, we hope to then take this project to the next stage of working with economics (particularly tokenomics) experts to create the appropriate agreements in place to attempt and change the behaviour of the participants such as farmers and councils.
4. The AgriDataTrade (http://www.agridatatrade.com/) project started with participation in the NZ Aerospace Challenge 2019 Virtual Incubator while engaging with farmers in the Rangitikei River catchment area. We built on our collaborators’ experience building the DAO IPCI, a blockchain market-based interaction protocol for climate change mitigation programmes and activities developed to implement UNFCCC Paris Agreement Article 6.
The approach was triggered by Anton Galenovich’s work on carbon trading https://ipci.io/how-the-coase-paradigm-may-be-applied-to-climate-change/; https://medium.com/dao-ipci/blockchain-incarnation-of-the-coase-paradigm-563f12b0adaa

## 5. Expected results :package:

We aim to have a working platform to demonstrate as a proof of concept and to attract funding and interest from farmers, councils, and economists planning to eventually create a nationwide water (and soil) pollution marketplace. The prototype will be followed by a technical white paper and publications promoting the project. We have full permission from their Rangitekei Rivers Water Quality Monitoring Group to install sensors on private property in any of 33 sites https://is.gd/gDs7xd on a permanent ongoing basis. We plan to install 6 sensors on 2 farms from the list of sites for real-time monitoring through the Robonomics Network

## 8. Additional Information :information_source: 
  New Zealand’s premier industry is considered to be Agriculture. Climate change and clean water in our rivers are also at the forefront of New Zealand’s concerns. Luckily, with the advances in precision agriculture and the efficiency of our world-leading practices, our sheep and beef farmers can claim to produce less Greenhouse Gas Emissions to get a piece of meat to a dinner table in London than the comparable farmers in Wales: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGMeYKInAk
  
One of the areas of great concern to consumers is the effect farming has on our land and water. An example of such impact can be the Nitrate (NO3) leaching from either crops or animals on the farms that makes its way to our waterways.  However, connecting such environmental impacts to the actual reasonable mitigation policies, estimating the marginal harm to the various users living in the environment, and behaviour changes required of the participants remain largely unsolved and often unattainable goals with farmers disagreeing with the council’s environmental economists and vice-versa.

The project is driven by the idea of considering the participants of the farming ecosystem to be a  part of  a self-governing body, a Social Enterprise. For the accounting for environmentally responsible agriculture, we start from a community of a few neighbouring farms where the market can be described under the logic of the commons. Farming communities create shared value (Natural Capital) through open contributory systems, govern their common work through participatory practices, and create shared resources. This creates A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) created to capture the pollution impacts such as “N leaching” in “kg per ha per year” for each of the 20,000 or so farms in New Zealand to enable a marketplace in the style of “token economy” to both establish a fair market price for pollution mitigation and to convince the farmers of the impacts of their behaviours and the effect they may (or may not) have on their bottom line.

For example, imagine that each farm in New Zealand somehow obtained actual values of N leaching (as well as other pollution indicators) that then were converted to tokens inversely proportional to the amount of N leached per hectare. A farm of 1000 hectares and small values of N leaching per hectare may get 5000 tokens, while a farm of 10000 hectares but with large values of N leaching per hectare may get just 1000 tokens. The local council may then decide to charge rates or allocate the voting power to each farm, not per the number of hectares each farm owns, but by the number of such tokens – thus immediately placing economic pressure to improve farmer behaviour. This can be done in a decentralised and transparent manner for all participants with “smart contract” style transparent rules established to guide the decisions in such a marketplace.

The farmers may then decide to invest the money necessary to increase the number of tokens necessary by either updating trustworthy information about their N or P leaching or CO2 or other Greenhouse Gas emission values and the councils can work out the necessary rules in terms of land use restrictions based on the actual visible data allowing the marketplace to establish the most reasonable cost comparisons and estimate the environmental harm.

We intend to create a framework under which the communities can sustainably self-govern themselves.  Elinor Ostrom’s eight design principles can give us great insights into how economic cooperation can succeed and a basis to create a sustainable self-governing organisation of farming community translated to blockchain smart contracts: Clearly defined boundaries through token-based membership (Principle 1), Blockchain governance for collective decision-making with local conditions at check (Principles 2 & 3), Intelligent machine monitoring & learning (Principle 4), Graduated sanctions and easy-to-enforce conflict-resolution mechanisms through increasing stakes and smart-contract judge (Principles 5 & 6),  Higher-level recognition and nested design by programmable censorship resistance and complexity (Principles 7 & 8)

The decentralized and self-enforcing nature of blockchain-based smart contracts guarantees that decisions, made within this framework, are executed without censorship or control from higher-level authorities. Smart contract architectures can be organized in multiple nested layers providing for monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance. There are two approaches for solving the tragedy of commons – the Coase approach or the Pugovian tax approach. In our approach we consider the regulators to be a part of the market organisation. We analyse the cost of environmental programs and as in iteration, can use our market approach against the Peguvian tax approach assessing the “fairness” of the existing programs. 

In a truly market approach, the rights of commoners to devise their own rules of governance should not be challenged by external formal authorities. However, if we include the authorities to become a part of a self-organizing community, a part of the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) we can rely on the Coase approach to compute the required cost of mitigation, using the fact that transaction costs are minimal in an organization governed by a smart contract. 

In the context of market approach, a regulator establishes the limits of permissible impact, within which regulated participants have the opportunity for market redistribution of rights to business activities that cause damage to a third party (the commons), and may also have the right to acquire the results of the positive impact (credits). The establishment of mandatory limits for permissible impact is the source of demand for such credits. Compensation can be carried out through civil litigation or a voluntary positive social investment in the paradigm of commons.

The platform serves as means of securitisation of the environmental impact of farming practices followed by securitisation economic activities at a larger scale in farming. A farming-related activity is associated with security backed by a sustainability token, issued by an environmental regulatory body. 

Another key benefit of our offering is that by combining meteorological and climate change modelling data with historical land use information for a particular farm, we can provide farmers with more precise water and soil pollution modelling as long as they provide current and up to date land use data. Such precise (and especially historical) land use data can in turn be used to re-train and improve our inference based on the land data for the other farms where we either cannot or are not allowed to obtain the detailed land use and water and soil contamination data. As the number of farmer participants increases, the quality of the information provided for councils for all the relevant farms would increase. We can then further utilise the insurers to provide the necessary economic incentives for more farmers to be willing to share their land-use data thus improving the quality of the overall model.
